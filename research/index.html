		<p>
		I am broadly interested in the feedbacks between ecology and evolution in natural populations. My main study system is the human gut microbiome, because it is a highly complex ecosystem which
		exhibits rapid eco-evolutionary dynamics within human relevant time-scales. Human gut microbiota exhibit diverse metabolic and phenotypic capabilities, and the ecological roles and evolutionary dynamics
		of these properties are still poorly understood. I have also assisted with 
		research in ruminant microbiomes, soil microbes, fruit flies and yeast.
