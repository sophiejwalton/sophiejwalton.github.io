		<p>I am interested in how populations of cells and organisms — from microbes to cancer — evolve over time. To study the dynamics of evolution, I develop theoretical models, analyze large sets of genomic data, and occasionally do experiments. I am currently involved in several projects, some of which are highlighted below.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Statistics of linked loci</strong></p>
		<p> Together with Zhiru Liu and 
		<a href="https://bgoodlab.github.io/" target="_blank">Benjamin Good</a>, I study the properties of two-locus sampling distributions under mutation, selection, recombination, and drift. We use our theoretical predictions to gain insight into the patterns of recombination in bacterial populations.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Population genomics of the spoon-billed sandpiper</strong></p>
		<p>I used simulations and mathematical modeling to learn how past changes in the population size of a critically endangered bird species contributed to its present-day genetic diversity.
