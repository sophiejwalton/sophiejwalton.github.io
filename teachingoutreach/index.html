		<p>I believe that when people are supported and happy, great science follows. 
		To that end, I have engaged in mentorship, community building, and teaching throughout my time at Stanford.  </p>

		<p>I am currently a co-facilitator for BioBuds at Stanford. I work with a team of graduate instructors to provide mentorship and training on 
		the "hidden curriculum" of science and run a 10 week research internship for undergraduates. We also provide mentorship and teaching training to 
		postdocs and graduate students.</p>
