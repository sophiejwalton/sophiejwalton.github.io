	<p> I am a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/biophysics.html" target="_blank">Biophysics</a>  with <a href="https://bgoodlab.github.io/" target="_blank">Benjamin Good</a> and <a href="https://petrov.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Dmitri Petrov</a>. I study evolutionary ecology in gut microbiota. I have also devoted much of my PhD to mentorship, teaching, and service. </p>
	<br>
	<p>I did my undergraduate training at Caltech, where I received my B.S. in Bioengineering with a minor in Information and Data Science in 2020. As an undergraduate, I worked on a variety of projects in 
  biology and bioengineering. I studied the genetics of sleep and heat shock response in <Caenorhabditis elegans> with <a href="https://wormlab.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Paul Sternberg</a> and <a href="http://www.hanwanglab.com/" target="_blank">Han Wang</a>. I worked on machine learning methods for protein engineering 
  with <a href="http://www.proteindesign.org/" target="_blank">Possu Huang</a>, and I studied dosage control in cell populations with <a href="https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page/" target="_blank">Richard Murray</a>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p> I spend most of my free time running, climbing, hiking, backpacking, and hanging out with my cat Curly.  I grew up in the Bay Area, and I attended Sequoia High School in Redwood City.</p>
